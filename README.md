# fantasygrounds-parser (WIP)

A small CLI tool that reads a Fantasygrounds 5e campaign and generates statistics for it.

It should generate the following statistics:
- Damage done
- Damage received
- Healing done
- Death saves succeed failed
- Critical Hits/Misses

It also should generate various "Titles" for Characters:

- **Saint:** Most healing done
- **Lucky:** Most critical Hits
- **Greedy:** Most items taken from inventory
- **Unyielding:** Rolled 3 Natural 20s on Death Saving Throws
- **Linguist:** Was able to translate most messages
- **?:** Had top initiative most fights
- **Tank:** Most damage received
- **Killer:** Most finishing blows dealt
